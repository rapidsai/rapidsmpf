/**
 * @brief An asynchronous shuffler that allows concurrent insertion and extraction of
 * data.
 *
 * ShufflerAsync provides an asynchronous interface to the shuffler, allowing data to be
 * inserted while previously shuffled partitions are extracted concurrently. This is
 * useful for streaming scenarios where data can be processed as soon as individual
 * partitions are ready, rather than waiting for the entire shuffle to complete.
 *
 * Inserting the finished flags provides a token that one must await to "finalize"
 * extractions. One can asynchronously extract partitions before awaiting this token.
 *
 * @warning The finish token _must_ be awaited otherwise the shuffle will throw in
 * destruction or deadlocks will occur.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * auto shuffle = ShufflerAsync(...);
 * while (...) {
 *   shuffle.insert(...);
 * }
 * auto finished_token = shuffle.insert_finished(...);
 * for (auto i = 0; i < shuffle.local_partitions().size(); i++) {
 *   auto part = co_await shuffle.extract_any_async();
 * }
 * co_await finished_token;
 * @endcode{}
 *
 * @note One can launch more extraction tasks than there are partitions to extract, for
 * example if we have multiple consumers of a shuffle, the extraction will return
 * `std::nullopt` if no more partitions are available.
