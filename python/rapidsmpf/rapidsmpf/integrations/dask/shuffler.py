    A valid task graph for Dask execution.

    Notes
    -----
    A RapidsMPF shuffle operation comprises four general phases:

    **Staging phase**
    A new :class:`rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler` object must be staged on every worker
    in the current Dask cluster.

    **Insertion phase**
    Each input partition is split into a dictionary of chunks,
    and that dictionary is passed to the appropriate :class:`rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler`
    object (using `rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler.insert_chunks`).

    The insertion phase will include a single task for each of
    the ``partition_count_in`` partitions in the input DataFrame.
    The partitioning and insertion logic must be defined by the
    ``insert_partition`` classmethod of the ``integration`` argument.

    Insertion tasks are NOT restricted to specific Dask workers.
    These tasks may run anywhere in the cluster.

    **Barrier phase**
    All :class:`rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler` objects must be 'informed' that the insertion
    phase is complete (on all workers) before the subsequent
    extraction phase begins. We call this synchronization step
    the 'barrier phase'.

    The barrier phase comprises three types of barrier tasks:

    1. First global barrier - A single barrier task is used to
    signal that all input partitions have been submitted to
    a :class:`rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler` object on one of the workers. This task may
    also run anywhere on the cluster, but it must depend on
    ALL insertion tasks.

    2. Worker barrier(s) - Each worker must execute a single
    worker-barrier task. This task will call `insert_finished`
    for every output partition on the local :class:`rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler`. These
    tasks must be restricted to specific workers, and they
    must all depend on the first global barrier.

    3. Second global barrier - A single barrier task is used
    to signal that all workers are ready to begin the extraction
    phase. This task may run anywhere on the cluster, but it must
    depend on all worker-barrier tasks.

    **Extraction phase**
    Each output partition is extracted from the local
    :class:`rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler` object on the worker (using `rapidsmpf.shuffler.Shuffler.wait_on`
    and `rapidsmpf.integrations.cudf.partition.unpack_and_concat`).

    The extraction phase will include a single task for each of
    the ``partition_count_out`` partitions in the shuffled output
    DataFrame. The extraction logic must be defined by the
    ``extract_partition`` classmethod of the ``integration`` argument.

    Extraction tasks must be restricted to specific Dask workers,
    and they must also depend on the second global-barrier task.
