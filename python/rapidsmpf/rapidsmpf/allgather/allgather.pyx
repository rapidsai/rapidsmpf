cdef class AllGather:
    """
    AllGather communication service for distributed operations.

    The `rapidsmpf.allgather.AllGather` class provides a communication service
    where each rank contributes data and all ranks receive all inputs from all ranks.

    The implementation uses a ring broadcast algorithm where each rank receives a
    contribution from its left neighbor, forwards the message to its right neighbor
    (unless at the end of the ring) and then stores the contribution locally.

    Parameters
    ----------
    comm
        The communicator for communication between ranks.
    progress_thread
        The progress thread for asynchronous operations.
    op_id
        Unique operation identifier for this allgather. Must have a value
        between 0 and 255.
    br
        Buffer resource for memory allocation.
    statistics
        Statistics collection instance. If None, statistics is disabled.

    Notes
    -----
    The caller promises that inserted buffers are stream-ordered with respect to
    their own stream, and extracted buffers are likewise guaranteed to be stream-
    ordered with respect to their own stream.
