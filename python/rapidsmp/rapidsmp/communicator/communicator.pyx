    Abstract base class for a communication mechanism between nodes.

    Provides an interface for sending and receiving messages between nodes,
    supporting asynchronous operations, GPU data transfers, and custom logging.
    Concrete implementations must define the virtual methods to enable specific
    communication backends.

    Notes
    -----
    This class is designed as an abstract base class, meaning it cannot be
    instantiated directly. Subclasses are required to implement the necessary
    methods to support the desired communication backend and functionality.
